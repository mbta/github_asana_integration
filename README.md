# github-asana-integration

This code is run as an AWS lambda that acts as a webhook for Github Pull Request Events. It updates the location of Asana tasks on a sprint board when PRs are opened or merged. It requires the Asana ticket URL to be in the PR description. It also updates a custom field on Asana tasks called "GitHub PR" with the PR's URL, including when only the PR description is updated.

## Setup for local development

* `brew install python3`
* `pip install virtualenv`

In `app` dir,
  * `virtualenv -p python3 venv`
  * Whenever you want to develop, activate the virtual env via: `. venv/bin/activate`
  * Once activated `pip install -r requirements-dev.txt`
  * To update requirements for production
    * `rm -rf venv` (to start with a fresh venv without dev dependencies)
    * `virtualenv -p python3 venv`
    * `. venv/bin/activate`
    * `pip install -r requirements.txt`
    * `pip install <dep>` and `pip freeze > requirements.txt`

The project currently includes `autopep8` for formatting and `pylint` for linting.
  * `autopep -i handler.py`
  * `pylint handler.py`

## Configuration

The function requires a configuration file named `config.ini` to be read at runtime. The `app/config/` directory contains configuration files for each currently deployed function. The name of each file corresponds to the name of the Lambda function in AWS. The config file is copied into place automatically during deployment.

You can see an example configuration file with dummy values in `app/config/example_config.ini`.

## Deployment of new code

In the repo's base directory, run:

```bash
$ ./deploy.sh <lambda-function-name>
```

â€¦where `<lambda-function-name>` corresponds to the name of the Lambda function in AWS. The deploy script requires the [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) to be installed.

To test the deploy script, prepend `DRYRUN=true` to the command above. This will run all build steps, but won't update the Lambda code.
